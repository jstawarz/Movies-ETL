# Movies ETL

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are working with Amazing Prime video. Amazing Prime would like to develop an algorithm to identify movies that will become popular.
To accomplish this, Amazing Prime will be sponsoring a "hack-a-thon" in an effort to create the basis for this algorithm. We, along with Britta, 
have beeen tasked with creating the datasets for this event. We will be scraping data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, cleaning the data, then
providing it in one SQL database.  

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to reconfigure the code used in to initally clean the data. Amazing Prime would like to develop an
automated pipline that takes in new data, cleans it, and exports it to the existing SQL database.
